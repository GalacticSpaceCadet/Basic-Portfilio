	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Diana and I am a web developer. I to relocated to Austin in 2014 to persue a new career and cross Hill Country BBQ off of my bucket list. I initially got into code when a friend suggested I try to learn recursion on JavaScript and quickly discovered I was a masochist that enjoyed the frustration of working through the debugging process.  Actually, you should probably check out some of my work in the Portfolio section of this page. </p>

		<p>Are you still reading this section? Oh. *slowly places brisket back on plate* A little about me, I really enjoy science, hiking, geochaching, and Opera(genre > web browser). Most weekends you would probably find me in a musuem or at the park working on code while puppy watching.  </p>
